# Scania Theme

Scania theme is a package to style Scania looks and feel in the [Corporate UI 4.0 alpha setup](https://github.com/scania/corporate-ui-dev/).

## Installation

### CDN link

Add link to the script by adding the following to the `<head></head>`. Make sure to include scania-theme script BEFORE the corporate-ui script.
```
<script src="https://static.scania.com/build/global/themes/scania/1.x/scania-theme.js"></script>
<script src="https://static.scania.com/build/global/4.x/corporate-ui.js"></script>

defineCustomElements('all'); 
addTheme(scania);
